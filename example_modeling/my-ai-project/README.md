## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-ai-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

- **Data Exploration:**
  Open the Jupyter notebook located in `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` to explore the dataset and visualize data distributions.

- **Data Processing:**
  Use the `src/data_processing.py` script to load and process the raw data. The `process_data` function will clean and transform the data for training.

- **Model Training:**
  Run the `src/model_training.py` script to train the AI model using the processed data. The trained model will be saved as `models/model.pkl`.

- **Model Deployment:**
  Use the `src/model_deployment.py` script to deploy the trained model and make predictions on new data using the `predict` function.
