```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cnn-study-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To explore the dataset, open the `notebooks/exploration.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
- To train the CNN model, run the training script:
   ```
   python src/training/train.py
   ```
